/* Standard header file to define the argument types of the
   functions of the Functional Mock-up Interface 3.0-wg003.3.
   This header file must be utilized both by the model and
   by the simulation engine.

   Revisions:
   - Jul.  2, 2018: Changed fmi2 to fmi3 prefixes, merged binary type FCP-004
   - Apr.  8, 2018: Draft changes for FCP-004 Opaque Binary Types
   - Nov. 16, 2017: Draft changes for FCP-004 Opaque Binary Types
   - Nov.  5, 2017: Draft changes for FCP-004 Opaque Binary Types
   - Apr.  9, 2014: all prefixes "fmi" renamed to "fmi2" (decision from April 8)
   - Mar   31, 2014: New datatype fmiChar introduced.
   - Feb.  17, 2013: Changed fmiTypesPlatform from "standard32" to "default".
                     Removed fmiUndefinedValueReference since no longer needed
                     (because every state is defined in ScalarVariables).
   - March 20, 2012: Renamed from fmiPlatformTypes.h to fmiTypesPlatform.h
   - Nov.  14, 2011: Use the header file "fmiPlatformTypes.h" for FMI 2.0
                     both for "FMI for model exchange" and for "FMI for co-simulation"
                     New types "fmiComponentEnvironment", "fmiState", and "fmiByte".
                     The implementation of "fmiBoolean" is change from "char" to "int".
                     The #define "fmiPlatform" changed to "fmiTypesPlatform"
                     (in order that #define and function call are consistent)
   - Oct.   4, 2010: Renamed header file from "fmiModelTypes.h" to fmiPlatformTypes.h"
                     for the co-simulation interface
   - Jan.   4, 2010: Renamed meModelTypes_h to fmiModelTypes_h (by Mauss, QTronic)
   - Dec.  21, 2009: Changed "me" to "fmi" and "meModel" to "fmiComponent"
                     according to meeting on Dec. 18 (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - Dec.   6, 2009: Added meUndefinedValueReference (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - Sept.  9, 2009: Changes according to FMI-meeting on July 21:
                     Changed "version" to "platform", "standard" to "standard32",
                     Added a precise definition of "standard32" as comment
                     (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - July  19, 2009: Added "me" as prefix to file names, added meTrue/meFalse,
                     and changed meValueReferenced from int to unsigned int
                     (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - March  2, 2009: Moved enums and function pointer definitions to
                     ModelFunctions.h (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - Dec.  3, 2008 : First version by Martin Otter (DLR) and
                     Hans Olsson (Dynasim).
